# ChatGPT-API-Integration-and-Flask-Web-App-Development
Integration of the OpenAI ChatGPT API and the development of a Flask-based web application enables users to communicate with the AI language model through a web interface.

A. The intent and capabilities of the app.


The ChatGPT Flask web application's goal is to provide users with a straightforward and user-friendly interface via which they may communicate with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The programme connects with the GPT-3 API to provide replies in response to input requests from the user. An interactive web interface to access the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model is intended to be provided through the integration of the ChatGPT API and the Flask web app development. The programme allows users to provide prompts in natural language, and the GPT-3 model receives these prompts.Users can enter the prompt in natural language, and the app uses the ChatGPT API to transmit these prompts to the GPT-3 model. Based on the prompts, the model creates responses, which are then displayed to the consumers by the app. This app's goal is to demonstrate GPT-3's potential and give users a convenient way to experiment with it.


B. Guidelines for installing, configuring, and using the application.


1.) Clone the ChatGPT-Flask-App repository from Github to your local system using the command git clone.
2.) Use cd to access the project directory. ChatGPT-Flask-App
3.) Construct a virtual setting Python3 --man "venv venv"
4.) Launch the virtual environment by typing source venv/bin/activate (venvScriptsactivate on Windows).
5.) Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies.
[6.) Create a .env file and set the OpenAI API key: echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
7.) Start the Flask server and enter: flask run
8.) Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 or any other url it shows to use the application.
9.) Use the test_app code to test the app and its responses.
Note:  To create  an OpenAI API key, sign up for an account if u have not signed up at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.](https://beta.openai.com/signup/ in order to create an OpenAI API key.)


C. Illustrations of API requests and replies.

------->>Here is an illustration of how to use Python's requests package to make an API call to the ChatGPT endpoint:

import requests

prompt = "Hello, ChatGPT!"
url =   " https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions "

headers =   {
    " Content-Type " : " application/json ",
    " Authorization " : f" Bearer {API_KEY} "  # replace API_KEY with your actual API key
}

data = {
    "prompt": prompt,
    "max_tokens": 50,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "n " : 1,
    "stop": "\n"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())


------>>>Here is an example response:

 {
     " choices ": [
         {
            " text ": "This is the response from ChatGPT."
         }
     ]
 }

Note that the response may vary according to the prompts.

# ChatGPT-API-Integration-and-Flask-Web-App-Development
ChatGPT API Integration and Flask Web App Development involves connecting the OpenAI ChatGPT API to a Flask-based web application to allow users to interact with the AI language model via a web interface.


A. The purpose and functionality of the application.


The purpose of the ChatGPT Flask web application is to allow users to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model through a simple and user-friendly interface. The application integrates with the GPT-3 API to generate responses based on user input prompts.
The ChatGPT API integration and Flask web app development aim to provide an interactive web interface to access the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. Users can enter prompts in natural language, and the app sends these prompts to the GPT-3 model via the ChatGPT API. The model generates responses based on the prompts, and the app displays them to the users. The purpose of this app is to showcase the potential of GPT-3 and enable users to experiment with it in a user-friendly way.


B. Instructions on how to set up, install, and run the application.


1.)Clone the Github repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/username/ChatGPT-Flask-App.git
2.)Navigate to the project directory: cd ChatGPT-Flask-App
3.)Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv
4.)Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate (on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
5.)Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
6.)Create a .env file and set the OpenAI API key: echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
7.)Start the Flask server: flask run
8.)Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to use the application.
Note: To obtain an OpenAI API key, sign up for an account at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.


C.  Examples of API calls and responses.

------->>Here is an example of making an API call to the ChatGPT endpoint using Python's requests library:

import requests

prompt = "Hello, ChatGPT!"
url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions"

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"  # replace API_KEY with your actual API key
}

data = {
    "prompt": prompt,
    "max_tokens": 50,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "n": 1,
    "stop": "\n"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())


------>>>Here is an example response:

{
    "choices": [
        {
            "text": "This is the response from ChatGPT."
        }
    ]
}


Note that the actual response may vary depending on the input prompt and the parameters used..
